CGPFun
======
CGPFun is a small Clojure/Javascript program to demonstrate Cartesian Genetic Programming(CGP).
It's purpose is to approximate a subset of continuous R\ :sup:`n`\ -> R functions given a set of input and
output test values. Furthermore, this short program helps the author to deepen his understanding
of Clojure/Javascript.


TODO Clojure
------------

- Add additional nodes
- Further improving performance
- Implementing crossover (original CGP uses mutation only)
- Clean up the code and add tests
- Add a web interface for better visualization
  especially for R -> R functions(maybe)

TODO Javascript
---------------

- Port all the clojure nodes
- Add a migration scheme
